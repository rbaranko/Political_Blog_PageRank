# Political_Blog_PageRank

This project focuses on building and evaluating a network of political blogs who link to one another (either mulutally or one-way directed). The project's goal is to evaluate the centrality each blog using the PageRank and HITS algorithm. For the HITS hub and authority scores, their weights are defined recursively. A higher authority weight occurs if the page is pointed to by pages with high hub weights. A higher hub weight occurs if the page points to many pages with high authority weights.
